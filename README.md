# Implementation-of-various-coding-schemes-using-VHDL
I have gained a thorough understanding of and successfully implemented various coding schemes using Quartus software. This software effectively interprets and processes VHDL, which I have used in my project. This experience improved my proficiency in both the software and the language, enabling me to design and simulate digital systems effectively.
