# Implementation-of-various-coding-schemes-using-VHDL
This project centers on implementing various error-correction codes using VHDL, aimed at improving data integrity by detecting and correcting errors. Throughout the process, I gained significant expertise in VHDL and applied advanced mathematical techniques, such as matrix multiplication and polynomial division, through VHDL functions.
