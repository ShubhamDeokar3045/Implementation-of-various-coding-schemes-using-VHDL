Features

1) Hamming Code

- Designed with codewords containing n bits, where k are data bits and n-k are parity bits.
- The decoder is capable of single-bit error correction and two-bit error detection.

2) Hadamard Code

- Implemented with codewords of n bits, comprising k message bits and n-k parity bits.
- Provides error correction for up to (nâˆ’1)/2 bits.

3) Reed-Solomon Code

- Encoder generates n-symbol codewords from k data symbols with n-k parity symbols.
